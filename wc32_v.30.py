# see helperFunctions for mods 
# A. to audio playback
# I added two interruptions to the continuous playback
#	1. keypress 'space'
#   2. duration
# both are passed as function parameters.
# B. to text display.
# added a parameter for text size.
	
# conversion from steve's scripts
# minimum build.
# he's got stims mapped to a filepath, not just filename
# reads from a list of filepaths.
# I've got a list of filenames, so filepath needs to be appended, and column of filenames called (i.e. index the col position.)	

# gifs work with his script despite things...
# got the fixation to work
# 	converted ms to s
# .1s speed-run successful (with audio recording)
# minimum .csv data file added.
# added zfill p name.
# added demo instr, timedatestamp to data file
# wide data format
# tested that space doesn't override future trials, too, and/or bugs for a full run.


# TO DO: 

# fix quit/pause fns
""" Still haven't solved this. waitKeys does not advance [pauses all activity] until a certain time, then reports what happened during that time.
getKeys will work idiosyncratically.
the return function of get_keys from the hf.function seems to work. duplicate this.
